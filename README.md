# Chat Application in Node.js

## Description
The application enables users to pick custom usernames, join custom chatrooms and exchange text messages in a quick, real-time fashion using websockets (Socket.IO). Users can also share their location with each other (Google's Geolocation API).

## How to use
1. Navigate into root directory using terminal/console, then type **npm install** or **yarn install** (Linux users may have to prefix the command with *sudo* like this: *sudo npm install*). 
2. After installation, type **npm start** or **yarn start** to fire up the server, then using a browser of your choice, go to **localhost:3000**, where the app is served up.
